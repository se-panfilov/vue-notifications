# vue-notifications

**VueNotifications** - agnostic library for non-blocking notifications.

----

## Introduction and WTF is it?

`vue-notifications` is "Vue.js agnostic non-blocking notifications library"... and it's a lie \)\) Seriously.

`vue-notifications`it's basically **a bridge** between your actual app and UI-notfications libs, like [mini-toastr](https://github.com/se-panfilov/mini-toastr).

### Why do we need this?

Because we want to have a way to show notifications and a way to easy replace UI library that show them without rewrite the code.

### What `vue-notifications` actually do?

It's allow you to declare your notifications in blocks like this one:

```js
export default {
    name: 'DemoView',
    data () {
      //...
    },
    methods: {
      //...
    },
    notifications: {
      showLoginError: { // You can have any name you want instead of 'showLoginError'
        title: 'Login Failed',
        message: 'Failed to authenticate',
        type: 'error' // You also can use 'VueNotifications.types.error' instead of 'error'
      }
    }
  }
```

And then call it via `this`: `this.showLoginError()`, and also with some override props: `this.showLoginError({message: 'whatever'})`.

### Why do we need third-party UI lib \(like [mini-toastr](https://github.com/se-panfilov/mini-toastr)\)?

Well, because we want to be agnostic.
That's mean that if at some step you would be fucked up with your UI library, `vue-notifications` will allow you to replace it as much easy as possible. Basically you would be required to replace `vue-notifications`'s config. And that's all.



## Installation

Check the Docs: [Installation](https://se-panfilov.github.io/vue-notifications/docs/html/installation.html)

via npm:

```shell
npm i vue-notifications --save
```

via bower:

```sh
bower i vue-notifications --save
```
or download [latest release][1]

include in project:

## Getting started

Check the Docs: [Getting started](https://se-panfilov.github.io/vue-notifications/docs/html/getting-started.html)

```JS
import VueNotifications from 'vue-notifications'

Vue.use(VueNotifications, options)
```

### Setup and configuration \(necessary\)

As I said above - you have to use UI library that would draw actual notifications for you.

For this example I will use [mini-toastr](https://github.com/se-panfilov/mini-toastr)

##### Step-by-step guide

Let's do everything together

> If you don't want spend too much time with this shit - you can go ahead and copy-past whole code from the bottom of this page

Anyway

* Import `vue-notifications`

Here we're including `vue-notifications` and  `mini-toaster` in our project

```js
import VueNotifications from 'vue-notifications'
import miniToastr from 'mini-toastr'
```

P.S. don't forget to install `mini-toaste` \(`npm i mini-toastr --save`\)

* Setup types of the messages

This one is mostly related to `mini-toastr`. We basically want `mini-toastr` to have these 4 types of messages. Basically 'error' should be red and success - 'green'

```js
const toastTypes = {
  success: 'success',
  error: 'error',
  info: 'info',
  warn: 'warn'
}
```

* Activate `mini-toastr`

Here we make `mini-toasr` initialization with types from above

```js
miniToastr.init({types: toastTypes})
```

* Map `vue-notification` to `mini-toastr`

We want our messages to be called via `vue-notification`but be shown by `mini-toastr`, So :

```js
function toast ({title, message, type, timeout, cb}) {
  return miniToastr[type](message, title, timeout, cb)
}

const options = {
  success: toast,
  error: toast,
  info: toast,
  warn: toast
}
```

This stuff will forward our messages, so in case of 'success', it will call `miniToastr.success(message, title, timeout, cb)`, in case of 'error' it will call `miniToastr.error(message, title, timeout, cb)` and etc. Keep in mind that the types\(like "success", "error" and etc\) could be whatever you want. In this example we just use default stuff for both libs.

* Activate the plugin

Okay, now we have to pass our `options` into the plugin. Actually `vue-notification` has auto-install, but we want to pass options from above to it, so that's the case why do we do this manually

```js
Vue.use(VueNotifications, options)
```

##### All together

You can just copy-paste code below

```js
import VueNotifications from 'vue-notifications'

// Include mini-toaster (or any other UI-notification library)
import miniToastr from 'mini-toastr'

// We shall setup types of the messages. ('error' type - red and 'success' - green in mini-toastr)
const toastTypes = {
  success: 'success',
  error: 'error',
  info: 'info',
  warn: 'warn'
}

// This step requires only for mini-toastr, just an initialization
miniToastr.init({types: toastTypes})

// Here we are seting up messages output to `mini-toastr`
// This mean that in case of 'success' message we will call miniToastr.success(message, title, timeout, cb)
// In case of 'error' we will call miniToastr.error(message, title, timeout, cb)
// and etc.
function toast ({title, message, type, timeout, cb}) {
  return miniToastr[type](message, title, timeout, cb)
}

// Here we map vue-notifications method to function abowe (to mini-toastr)
// By default vue-notifications can have 4 methods: 'success', 'error', 'info' and 'warn'
// But you can specify whatever methods you want.
// If you won't specify some method here, output would be sent to the browser's console
const options = {
  success: toast,
  error: toast,
  info: toast,
  warn: toast
}

// Activate plugin
// VueNotifications have auto install but if we want to specify options we've got to do it manually.
Vue.use(VueNotifications, options)
```

## Usage

Check the Docs: [Usage](https://se-panfilov.github.io/vue-notifications/docs/html/usage.html)

```js
export default {
    name: 'DemoView',
    data () {
      //...
    },
    methods: {
      //...
    },
    notifications: {
      showLoginError: { // You can have any name you want instead of 'showLoginError'
        title: 'Login Failed',
        message: 'Failed to authenticate',
        type: 'error' // You also can use 'VueNotifications.types.error' instead of 'error'
      }
    }
  }
```

Now you can call `showLoginError` as a common method via this:

```js
this.showLoginError()
```

> **PRO tip**: Technically there is no difference between methods defined in `notifications: {...}` section and in `methods: {...}` section - they are all the same. So that's basically mean that** you shall not define methods with same name in those sections**, because they would overlap each other.

So, now you can do something like that:

```js
methods: {
  login () {
    loginUtil.login(err => if (err) this.showLoginError())
  }
}
```

But wait. What if I want to show some custom message in example above?

Well, in this case you can override `showLoginError()` method:

```js
this.showLoginError({message: err.message})
```

In the same way you can override all the others properties

```js
this.showLoginError({title: 'my title', message: 'just an error', type: 'warn', timeout: 1000})
```

### Options to override

As I said above, you can specify any of following properties

| Name | Type | Default value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| title | String | undefined | Notification's title \(can be empty\) |
| message | String | undefined | Notification's body message. Normally should be set up |
| timeout | Number | 3000 | time before notifications gone |
| cb | undefined | undefined | Callback function |

But actually you can add your own properties as well, if you want. Why and how? You can check it in [Advanced Setup](https://se-panfilov.github.io/vue-notifications/docs/html/advanced-setup.html) section.

## Browsers support.

Check the Docs: [Browsers support](https://se-panfilov.github.io/vue-notifications/docs/html/browsers-support.html)

All `ES5-compatable` browsers are supported \(i.g. starting from `IE11`\).
For more information, please chech [ECMAScript 5 compliant browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es5)

If you don't give a fuck about browsers support, it would be better to use `ES6-version`
